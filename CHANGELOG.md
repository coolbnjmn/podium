# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Podium is
pre-1.0, so a minor release can include breaking changes.

A release sets the version in `package.json` (root, `server` and `frontend`) and in
`mod/podium-reporter/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` to the same number. Between releases the mod's version can
be ahead, because a mod fix is bumped in its own PR.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `podiumctl start --mode standalone` no longer reports "Podium is up" when another process already holds
  the port. It fails before spawning, names the port and suggests `podiumctl status` or `--port`. If the
  server it spawned exits during startup, `start` now fails, shows the end of `podium.log` and leaves no
  pid file behind.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-11

First release. The repo started as a usage dashboard and became Podium, a live
fleet console for Claude Code sessions, with a container, a command-line manager
and a plugin you can install from a marketplace.

### Added

- **Podium fleet console** (`#/`, the default view). Every Claude Code session
  running with the reporter mod shows up in one browser tab within about two
  seconds: model and effort, plan, the agents it launched (subagents and forks),
  estimated cost, context-window fill, context blowouts, failures with the
  failing call and its last output, and the git branch or worktree. Sessions
  appear and leave on their own. Podium only observes; it never sends a prompt or
  touches a session. (PR #2)
- **Reporter mod** (`mod/podium-reporter/`): a Claude Code mod that reports a
  full snapshot plus unacknowledged events, redacts anything that looks like a
  secret, queues reports while the server is down, and adds the `/podium`
  command and a status line entry. Options: `serverUrl`, `token`,
  `flushIntervalMs`, `heartbeatMs`, `sessionName`, `showStatus`,
  `explainFailures`. (PR #2)
- **Server** (`server/src/fleet/`): hand-written validation of every report,
  SQLite storage through `node:sqlite`, Server-Sent Events for live updates,
  stale and drop timers, retention, and a `/history` endpoint. A shared token
  (`PODIUM_TOKEN`) guards reports, hooks and deletes. (PR #2)
- **Settings-hook ingest** (`POST /api/fleet/hook`): a reduced view of sessions
  started without the mod, from Claude Code's settings hooks. (PR #2)
- **History page** (`#/history`) listing the sessions that ended on a chosen
  day. (PR #2)
- **Simulator, smoke and soak scripts** (`scripts/podium-sim.ts`,
  `podium-smoke.sh`, `podium-soak.sh`) for developing and checking Podium with no
  real sessions. (PR #2)
- **`podiumctl`** (`bin/podiumctl.mjs`): start, stop, restart, status, logs,
  health, token, config, enable and disable (start on boot through launchd or a
  systemd user unit), shell and rm, in either a Podman container or a standalone
  Node process. The first start generates an auth token and saves it to
  `~/.podium/config.env`. (PR #3)
- **Container image** (`Containerfile`): a two-stage Node 24 build that runs as
  a non-root user and keeps its database in a `/data` volume. (PR #3)
- **Marketplace install.** `podium-reporter` is listed in
  `eengelking-marketplace` (`eengelking/skills`):
  `/plugin install podium-reporter@eengelking-marketplace`. (`eengelking/skills`
  PRs #32 and #33)
- **Docs:** `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/DEMO.md`,
  `docs/DECISIONS.md`, `docs/GOTCHAS.md`, `docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  and the `.github/` community files, issue and PR templates, and CI.
  (PRs #1, #4, #6 and this release)
- **Usage dashboard** (`#/usage`, the earlier app): charts Claude Code and
  Anthropic Admin API usage from local logs and the Admin API.

### Changed

- The project was renamed from `claude-dashboard` to `podium`
  (`eengelking/podium`). (PR #5)
